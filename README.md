This project explores UFO sightings through the state of California from 2004-2014, relating sightings to health outcomes, weather events, and other supernatural sightings.

Historically, there has been little research investigating UFO sightings, and which factors may contribute to higher sightings in specific counties. As a result, we created a dashboard to visualize trends in UFO sightings across the state of California and over time, to explore potential associations between these and other phenomena. In our analysis, We were primarily concerned with Bigfoot sightings, to determine whether correlation was observed for two distinct supernatural observations, hinting at sociological pressures; years of potential life lost (YPLL), indicative of county health; and temperature and precipitation events, to see if visibility trends impacted sightings. 

Functional and machine learning paradigms were used in our project - the former during data collection, wrangling, and visualization, and the latter to explore average sighting duration and sighting count as metrics. 

While our analysis highlighted several interesting details about UFO sightings, our correlative research was positive in one particular aspect: supernatural sighting overlap. Accounting for per capita sighting rates, we determined positive correlation between the number of bigfoot sightings and UFO sightings at the county level, at R^2 = 0.88 for non-logarithmic data (though skewed by outliers), and R^2 = 0.64 for logarithmic data.
